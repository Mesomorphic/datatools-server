# Transit Data Manager

The core application for Conveyal's transit data tools suite.

## AMAL SIGGESC2GTFS Project

Conveyal is working with Algarve, Portugal, to convert the SIGGESC national transit data format to GTFS. This work will provide all agencies with data structured in SIGGESC to take advantage of GTFS and the broad network of applications and services that utilize the data specification.
